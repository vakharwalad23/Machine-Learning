# Machine Learning

A minimal, curated set of hands-on notebooks to learn:
- ML (classification, regression, clustering, model selection)
- DL (LSTM/RNN, basic model building)
- NLP (sentiment analysis, text preprocessing)
- MLOps basics (MLflow, DVC, BentoML, deployment)

## Quick Start

1. Create a Python env (recommended: Python 3.10+):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Notes
- See [Notes](Notes/) for PDFs on statistics and deep learning basics.
